# Kodecamp 5.0 DevOps Stage 1 Task
## Foundational DevOps Content
### DevOps Definition
DevOps is the integration of software development and information technology (IT) operations. It is a way of working in tech where software developers (the people who write code) and operations teams (the people who manage and run the software) work closely together. Instead of working separately, they team up to build, test, and release software faster and more reliably. DevOps is about improving communication, utilizing intelligent tools, and automating tasks to enable quick updates and fixes without disrupting operations.

### Core Principles
#### Collaboration
DevOps encourages teamwork between developers and operations. Instead of working in silos (separately), they share ideas, tools, and responsibilities to build better software together.
#### Automation
Tasks like testing, building, and deploying software are automated as much as possible. This helps speed up the process and reduces human errors.
#### Continuous Integration & Continuous Delivery (CI/CD)
This means code is regularly added (integrated), tested, and quickly delivered (or deployed) to users; this means updates and new features are released faster and more often.
#### Monitoring and Feedback
DevOps teams regularly check how their software works (monitoring) and use feedback from users and systems to improve it. If something breaks, they know quickly and can fix it fast.
#### Culture of Improvement
DevOps promotes learning, innovation, and improvement over time. Mistakes are learning opportunities, and teams are encouraged to get better.
#### User-Centred 
The main goal is to deliver value to the user. Everything,  from coding, testing, to deployment, is done with the user’s experience in mind.


## Lifecycle Stages
### Planning
This is where the team decides what features or fixes are needed. Goals are set, tasks are organized, and everyone agrees on what needs to be done.

### Development
Developers write the actual code to create new features or solve problems. They work in small steps to make changes and testing easier.

### Building
The written code is combined and turned into a working software product. This step often includes checking for errors and preparing the code for testing.

### Testing
The software is tested to ensure everything works as expected. This helps catch bugs early before the software reaches users.

### Release
The team prepares the tested software for delivery. It's the final check before making it available to users.

### Deployment
The software launches officially, making it available to users. In DevOps, this is often automated and happens quickly after a successful release.

### Operations
This involves managing the software while it’s running, keeping it fast, secure, and reliable. The operations team also handles any issues that come up after deployment.

### Monitoring
The system is checked regularly to track performance, errors, and user activity. This helps with fixing problems quickly and improving future versions.
